# WELCOME!  

Hello! If your reading this I am surprised you found it. If you couldn't tell by the title, tags, and intro, *this* is my first post on my website. I have always wanted to start a blog like this and I am excited to see where it goes. For this site, I am using the static site generator Hugo, the Hugo theme neopost (by salatine and cartola), and I am hosting it on GitHub Pages. I may try to make a short guide on how to get a website like this going in the future, so keep an eye out for that!

My goal with starting this blog is just to have fun. I think it would be cool to maybe eventually get involved in a community, I am also just fine typing things out into the void of the internet. Also, I would really like to learn some coding and I am hoping this will be a little project that can help me with that. I guess you could say the grand picture is to make this my little corner of the internet to mess around with.  That'll be all for my intro post, but I imagine I will be back with another post sooner rather than later.
