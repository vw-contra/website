# DELTARUNE ^_^

I felt obligated to write at least a little about this because of the impact Undertale had on me (and everyone else) when I first played it. This post is gonna be spoiler-free, and I will tag any future gametime posts here at the beginning if they do have spoilers.   

Deltarune came out yesterday, and I only got to play it for about 40 minutes, but I can already tell it's gonna be a gem. Sure, there is a nostalgia factor at play, but there are so many factors beyond that. In classic Toby Fox style, the music almost immediately pulls you into this world that he built. The artstyle of the game pairs perfectly with the music, and it creates these moments that make you just want to stop and soak it in. Like I said in the beginning, I only played for 40 minutes, but I am already very interested in the story as well. The intro sequence immediately hooked me, and I was charmed with some familiar faces and also some not-so-familiar faces that I actually want to learn more about. If you are not familiar with this game, you should definitely look into it. If you are familiar with this game, I hope I did it justice with my writing. If you've never played Undertale, *what are you doing??* Seriously though, you should check it out. It goes on sale often and for very cheap, and I hope it will be as endearing and memorable for you as it was for me.  

This concludes my obligatory Deltarune post. I am certain I will be posting about it again. Like I said, I'm gonna try and keep everything on here spoiler-free. This year has already been so great for gaming, and I look forward to playing and writing about some of the titles that have made it so great.

# website plans/ ramblings  

Now it's time to talk website plans, big and small. I'd like to make a habit of writing about changes I've made or changes I would like to make to the site. I'm hoping this will kinda keep a fire under me to continue improving things and getting the site just right. As a disclaimer, I have no prior coding experience , so some of these changes may seem like small things, but I have no earthly clue how to implement them so it will be a journey :)  

First thing I would like to do is fix the issue with tags on the site. Currently, if you click on a tag on one of the posts, it gives you a 404 error. Surprisingly, this is not the goal. It should be directing you to a page that has other posts containing that tag. I would really like to try and fix it today, but I have tried to fix it over the course of the past few days with no success. **I will be victorious**  

A couple other things I would like to implement are a dark mode toggle (by popular request) and maybe like a photo gallery or some sort of way to showcase a spotify playlist or something.  

I also would like to kinda keep up with some other projects on here. I'm currently on the prowl for a thinkpad at a good price, and when I get that I plan to put arch linux on it to tinker with. I'm hoping that this will be a good ~hair pulling~ learning experience for me. Plus, windows is extremely annoying and I would like to be a bigger advocate for open-source software. I have a couple other fun ideas in mind, but there's no point crossing that bridge until we get there. That's all for post numero three. Expect another post in the coming days, potentially with another music talk.
