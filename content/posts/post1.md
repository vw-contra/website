<!-- introduction -->
An introduction and some words..
<!--more-->
Hello! If your reading this I am surprised you found it. If you couldn't tell by the title, tags, and intro, *this* is my first post on my website. I have always wanted to start a blog like this and I am excited to see where it goes. I would like to acknowledge a few things that made it possible for me to be typing this right now. First off, my good friend (who knows who he is) that had the knowledge of how to set all of this up. For this site, I am using the static site generator Hugo, the Hugo theme neopost (by salatine and cartola), and I am hosting it on GitHub Pages.

My goal with starting this blog is just to have fun. I think it would be cool to maybe eventually get involved in a community, I am also just fine typing things out into the void of the internet. Also, I would really like to learn some coding and I am hoping this will be a little project that can help me with that. I guess you could say the grand picture is to make this my little corner of the internet to mess around with.  That'll be all for my intro post, but I imagine I will be back with another post sooner rather than later.
