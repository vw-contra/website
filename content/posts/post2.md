A brief chat about the site and that ominous bird. + music talk

# bird talk

I honestly don't have a ton to talk about on this post, I just wanted to throw something out there. I made some updates to the site today that took me an embarrasing amount of time and research o_O. 

I changed the theme to be purple-centric with some gloriously painful yellow text. (for the sake of our eyes main text will remain black.. for now..) 

I added a button that will allow my millions of fans worldwide to email me. Go ahead and try it out, but you all should consider taking turns as to not overwhelm google's servers.

It turns out that the bird was just click-bait to get you reading this right here. You can escape YouTube, but you can't escape the clickbait. Not even here, in the far-out reaches of the internet, can you find shelter from it. Though the bird is ominous, he is just a lil guy.

# music talk

Music is a pretty big part of my life. That means I will probably be talking about it a good bit here on this site. I can't promise that every post will be awe-inspiring, and I often have pretty bad opinions, but I will yap nonetheless. 

In this first music talk I want to talk about an artist I came across a few months ago called [idialedyournumber](https://idialedyournumber.com). I have really been enjoying her music, and she actually has a blog that partially inspired my creation of this one :) 

I'm really bad at putting genres on music, but two of the things that I love about her music are the mix of midwest emo (*my beloved*) riffs and chiptune sounds. I think that mixture makes really interesting music that I don't get tired of. I think both of her albums (Hourglass and Mourning Glow) are really great and i've been listening to both of them a lot recently. 

Here are my top five from both of their albums:  
  
    - 6:00 am  
    - Ghost Hands  
    - Hourglass  
    - I Am No Longer In Control Of My Body  
    - Good News & Bad News  
      
That top five has been changing a lot too, so I would definitely recommend taking a dive into their music.  

That's about all I got for this first music talk. During these, I am really just gonna be talking about music I actively like, so don't expect any Fantano-level discourse coming from me.
